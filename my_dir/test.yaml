context:
  description: |-
    This detector identifies instances of cmd.exe executing with a command line parameters containing multiple &'s as well as references to xcopy and the startup folder.
  normal_behavior_notes: |-
    Aside from rare admin fringe cases / IT setup, this behavior is abnormal and should be cause for concern.
    Identify any additional commands taking place alongside xCopy and activity in the user's Startup directory to determine further malicious or suspect activity.
  malicious_behavior_notes: |-
    Previous malicious/adversary activity has had consistent patterns matched with the behavior detected.
    Use extra scrutiny when examining the additional command line parameters if applicable, as well as investgating filemods (in or out of Startup), netconns, and childprocs.
